## An excellent resume has the power to open doors.

Your resume describes your qualifications and what makes you unique. To stand out among other applicants, you need a resume that markets your strengths and match for the job.

A great resume:

- Grabs the attention of employers and recruiters
- Sells your strongest skills and accomplishments
- Shows how youâ€™re a match for a position or project
- And most importantly, gets you a job interview!
- Highlight accomplishments instead of job duties
